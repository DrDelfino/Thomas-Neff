          <p>
            In this post, I'll show you how I developed and deployed this
            website in three steps.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Setting up - Visual Studio Code, GitHub, npm, Git, Bootstrap
            </li>
            <li>Developing - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li>Deploying - Netlify</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Feel free to follow along and create your own website. It's fast,
            easy, and free!
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Please note that these steps are written for Windows users.</i>
          </p>

          <!-- Setting Up -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Setting up</h2>
          <p>
            If you're a seasoned developer, you can probably skip most of this
            section. But if your new to development, let's get you set up.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Download an IDE (Visual Studio Code)</h5>
          <p>
            First, you will want to open (or download) an Integrated Development
            Environment (IDE). This is a fancy name for the software that will
            let you edit your code. Many developers use Visual Studio Code, and
            it's my tool of choice as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://code.visualstudio.com/</a
            >
          </p>

          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a package manager (npm)</h5>
          <p>
            Now it's time to install npm (originally Node Package Manager). In
            an effort to keep things simple, let's just say we'll use npm to
            download and install stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank"
              >https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to understand npm a little better, check out this

              target="_blank"
              >stack overflow post</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a version control tool (Git)</h5>
          <p>
            Next, install Git. Git will help us with version control, making it
            easy to push and pull changes from our command line.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"
              >https://git-scm.com/downloads</a
            >
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a code repository (GitHub)</h5>
          <p>
            Once you have everything installed, it's time to set up a code
            repository. For this example, we'll be using GitHub. Navigate to
            their website and set up an account, if you don't already have one.
            Then, follow the on-screen instructions to create a new repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://github.com/</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You can look at
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository</a
            >
            for this website as an example.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Clone your repository</h5>
          <p>
            We want to make changes to the code in our online code repository
            (GitHub) using our local machine's IDE (Visual Studio Code). To do
            that, we need to clone the repository to our local machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navigate to your repository in GitHub. Here is
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository
            </a>
            for this website again as an example. Click on the green button that
            says "Code". It should look similar to the button below.
          </p>
          <button class="btn-github btn-lg mx-auto d-block" href="#">
            <i class="fas fa-download"></i> Code
            <i class="fas fa-sort-down pb-1"></i>
          </button>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Copy the HTTPS link that appears. It should look similar to the
            screenshot below, but with your repository information.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/GitHub-clone.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Open Visual Studio Code. You should be greeted with a welcome screen
            that has a link to clone a repository.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/VSCode-welcome.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Click on <i>clone repository...</i> and paste the link from GitHub.
            You will be prompted to save the repository somewhere on your PC.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a responsive framework (Bootstrap)</h5>
          <p>
            Bootstrap is a front-end framework that helps to make your website
            responsive, ensuring your site will look great on various screen
            sizes. There are lots of ways to install Bootstrap, but let's take
            advantage of our shiny new package manager, npm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within Visual Studio Code, make sure you are in the folder where you
            cloned your repository. Open the terminal using
            <code> Ctrl+Shift+`</code>
            or by clicking terminal > New Terminal in the top menu bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the terminal, verify npm installed correctly by writing the
            command <code>npm -v</code>. You should get back a version number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now install Bootstrap using the command
            <code>npm install bootstrap --save</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Bootstrap to work correctly, you will also need the JavaScript
            library, jQuery. Install jQuery using the command
            <code>npm install jquery --save</code>.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Summary</h5>
          <p>
            Our development environment is now set up! Here's a quick summary of
            everything we did:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Downloaded Visual Studio Code to edit our code</li>
            <li>Installed npm to manage packages</li>
            <li>Installed Git to help with version control</li>
            <li>Created a code repository in GitHub</li>
            <li>Cloned the code repository to our local machine</li>
            <li>Installed Bootstrap to make our site responsive</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Developing -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Developing</h2>
          <p>
            We made it to the fun part! Time to start developing our website.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a homepage</h5>
          <p>
            Within Visual Studio Code, make sure you are in the folder where you
            cloned your repository. In the file explorer on the left-hand side,
            click on the symbol:
            <img
              class="img"
              style="height: 30px"
              src="../assets/Add-file.png"
            />
            to add a file and name it index.html. This will be the homepage for
            your website. Copy and paste the following code into your index.html
            and hit save.
          </p>
          <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
            Author's note - need to fix css and js references to hit the correct
            files in the node_modules folder, as well as to not show entire
            filepath. Also, add in a container, a row, and maybe a paragraph.
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Thomas-Neff/26e2628115f648c1efaf2d634be79819.js"></script>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Render and view your homepage</h5>
          <p>
            In order to view your code in a browser, we will add an extension
            called Live Server. Click on the symbol:
            <img
              class="img"
              style="height: 30px"
              src="../assets/Extensions.png"
            />
            on the left-hand menu bar in Visual Studio Code to view extensions.
            Search for Live Server and click install. After it's done
            installing, restart Visual Studio Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open index.html within Visual Studio Code, and click on the button:
            <img class="img" style="height: 18px" src="../assets/Go-Live.png" />
            in the bottom right-hand tool bar. Your browser will open and you
            should see a rendering of your local code.
          </p>
          <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
            Author's note - need to come back and fix the following preview
            after I fix the code snippet above.

            Note on branches - if you are working with other developers, you
            should
            <a
              href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell"
              target="_blank"
              >learn about branches</a
            >. It is not a best practice to work out of the main branch (which
            is where we're working); however - it's your site, and you can do
            what you want. I work out of the main branch on my own website,
            because I'm the only one here and I am living on the edge.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Build your dream site</h5>
          <p>
            You have everything you need to build a beautiful, responsive site.
            If this is your first time working with Bootstrap, I recommend
            creating your site from scratch until you understand the framework.
            Once you have the basics, you can start customizing templates that
            other developers have created and shared.

          <!-- Deploying -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Deploying</h2>
          <p>
            It's time to make our website available to the masses. There are
            lots of ways to deploy a static website, but I'm going to recommend
            one that my friend Matt Rodgers from
            <a href="https://matthewdavidrodgers.com/" target="_blank"
              >matthewdavidrodgers.com</a
            >
            turned me on to: Netlify.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Deploying with Netlify - an anecdote</h5>
          <p>
            Netlify is so easy that when I had a time sensitive emergency to
            deploy a JavaScript pickle calculator (I wish I could tell you more
            about that, but this is a portfolio - not a blog - remember?) I
            turned to Netlify. Even though it was my first time using the tool
            and I had to go through the sign up process, I had a working, live
            website in under 10 minutes.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Deploying with Netlify</h5>
          <p>Here are your Netlify instructions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Go to
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">netlify.com</a>
              and sign up using your GitHub account
            </li>
            <li>
              Click on the <i>New site from Git</i> button and select GitHub
            </li>
            <li>Select your repository</li>
            <li>Click deploy site</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Netlify will auto-generate a domain name for you, which you can
            change later. The initial deployment will take a few minutes. In the
            future, every time you make changes to your main branch in GitHub,
            Netlify will automatically deploy in a matter of seconds.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Congratulations!</h5>
          <p>
            If you followed along, you now have a live, functioning website for
            the world to enjoy. If you are just a reader, hopefully you have a
