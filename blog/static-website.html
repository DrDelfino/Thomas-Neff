            Technology Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Netlify
          </h5>

          <p>
            In this post, I'll show you how I developed and deployed this
            website in three steps.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Setting up - Visual Studio Code, GitHub, npm, Git, Bootstrap
            </li>
            <li>Developing - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap</li>
            <li>Deploying - Netlify</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Feel free to follow along and create your own website. It's fast,
            easy, and free!
          </p>

          <!-- Setting Up -->
          <h3 class="pt-3 pb-3">Setting up</h3>
          <p>
            If you're a seasoned developer, you can probably skip most of this
            section. But if your new to development, let's get you set up.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Download an IDE (Visual Studio Code)</h5>
          <p>
            First, you will want to open (or download) an Integrated Development
            Environment (IDE). This is a fancy name for the software that will
            let you edit your code. Many developers use Visual Studio Code, and
            it's my tool of choice as well.
          </p>

              >https://code.visualstudio.com/</a
            >
          </p>

          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a package manager (npm)</h5>
          <p>
            Now it's time to install npm (originally Node Package Manager). In
            an effort to keep things simple, let's just say we'll use npm to
            download and install stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank"
              >https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>

              >stack overflow post</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a version control tool (Git)</h5>
          <p>
            Next, install Git. Git will help us with version control, making it
            easy to push and pull changes from our command line.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a code repository (GitHub)</h5>
          <p>
            Once you have everything installed, it's time to set up a code
            repository. For this example, we'll be using GitHub. Navigate to
            their website and set up an account, if you don't already have one.
            Then, follow the on-screen instructions to create a new repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://github.com/</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You can look at
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository</a
            >
            for this project as an example.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Clone your repository</h5>
          <p>
            We want to make changes to the code in our repository (GitHub) using
            our IDE (Visual Studio Code). To do that, we need to clone the
            repository to our local machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navigate to your repository in GitHub. Here is
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository </a
            >again as an example. Click on the green button that says "Code". It
            should look similar to this:
          </p>
          <button class="btn-github">
            <i class="fas fa-download"></i> Code
            <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i>
          </button>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a responsive framework (Bootstrap)</h5>
          <p>
            Bootstrap is a front-end framework that helps to make your website
            responsive, ensuring your site will look great on various screen
            sizes. There are lots of ways to install Bootstrap, but let's take
            advantage of our shiny new package manager, npm.
