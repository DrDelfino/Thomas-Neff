          <h4 class="pb-3">Date Pending</h4>

          <p>
            In this post, I'll show you how to develop and deploy a simple
            website in three steps.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Setting up - Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Git, Bootstrap</li>
            <li>Developing - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li>Deploying - Netlify</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We'll use my website,
            <a href="https://thomasneff.com/" target="_blank"
              >thomasneff.com,</a
            >
            as an example along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Please note that these steps are written for Windows users.</i>
          </p>

          <!-- Setting Up -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Setting up</h2>
          <p>
            If you're a seasoned developer, you can probably skip most of this
            section. But if your new to development, let's get you set up.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Download an IDE (Visual Studio Code)</h5>
          <p>
            First, you will want to open (or download) an Integrated Development
            Environment (IDE). This is a fancy name for the software that will
            let you edit your code. Many developers use Visual Studio Code, and
            it's my tool of choice as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://code.visualstudio.com/</a
            >
          </p>

          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a version control tool (Git)</h5>
          <p>
            Next, install Git. Git will help us with version control, making it
            easy to push and pull changes from our command line.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"
              >https://git-scm.com/downloads</a
            >
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a code repository (GitHub)</h5>
          <p>
            Once you have everything installed, it's time to set up a code
            repository. For this example, we'll be using GitHub. Navigate to
            their website and set up an account, if you don't already have one.
            Then, follow the on-screen instructions to create a new repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://github.com/</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You can look at
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository</a
            >
            for this website as an example.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Clone your repository</h5>
          <p>
            We want to make changes to the code in our online repository
            (GitHub) using our local machine's IDE (Visual Studio Code). To do
            that, we need to clone the repository to our local machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navigate to your repository in GitHub. Here is
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository
            </a>
            for this website again as an example. Click on the green button that
            says "Code". It should look similar to the button below.
          </p>
          <button class="btn-github btn-lg mx-auto d-block" href="#">
            <i class="fas fa-download"></i> Code
            <i class="fas fa-sort-down pb-1"></i>
          </button>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Copy the HTTPS link that appears. It should look similar to the
            screenshot below, but with your repository information.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/GitHub-clone.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Open Visual Studio Code. You should be greeted with a welcome screen
            that has a link to clone a repository.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/VSCode-welcome.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Click on <i>clone repository...</i> and paste the link from GitHub.
            You will be prompted to save the repository somewhere on your PC.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a responsive framework (Bootstrap)</h5>
          <p>TBD - CDN</p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Summary</h5>
          <p>
            Our development environment is now set up! Here's a quick summary of
            everything we did:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Downloaded Visual Studio Code to edit our code</li>
            <li>Installed Git to help with version control</li>
            <li>Created a code repository in GitHub</li>
            <li>Cloned the code repository to our local machine</li>
            <li>Added the BootstrapCDN to make our site responsive</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Developing -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Developing</h2>
          <p>
            We made it to the fun part! Time to start developing our website.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a homepage</h5>
          <p>
            Within Visual Studio Code, make sure you are in the folder where you
            cloned your repository. In the file explorer on the left-hand side,
            click on the symbol:
            <img
              class="img"
              style="height: 30px"
              src="../assets/Add-file.png"
            />
            to add a file and name it index.html. This will be the homepage for
            your website. Copy and paste the following code into your index.html
            and hit save.
          </p>
          <p>
            I included some additional comments to help explain the HTML for
            beginners.
          </p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Thomas-Neff/26e2628115f648c1efaf2d634be79819.js"></script>
          <p>
            Note that I included Popper.js and jQuery JavaScript libraries,
            which are both necessary for Bootstrap to function correctly (though
            Bootstrap 5 has removed jQuery as a requirement).
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Render and view your homepage</h5>
          <p>
            In order to view your code in a browser, we will add an extension
            called Live Server. Click on the symbol:
            <img
              class="img"
              style="height: 30px"
              src="../assets/Extensions.png"
            />
            on the left-hand menu bar in Visual Studio Code to view extensions.
            Search for Live Server, verify the extension is made by "Ritwick
            Dey" (it should be the first result) and click install. After it's
            done installing, restart Visual Studio Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open index.html within Visual Studio Code, and click on the button:
            <img class="img" style="height: 18px" src="../assets/Go-Live.png" />
            in the bottom right-hand tool bar. Your browser will open and you
            should see a rendering of your local code.
          </p>
          <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
            Author's note - need to come back and fix the following preview
            after I fix the code snippet above.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/first-bootstrap-website.webp"
          />
          <h5 class="pt-3">Understand the Bootstrap grid</h5>
          <p>
            Bootstrap uses a grid system to make your site responsive on any
            screen size. Each row is divided into 12 units.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Below is an example of a row with three <b>equal width</b> columns.
          </p>
          <div class="row text-white text-center pb-3">
            <div class="col-4 bg-primary pt-3">

            This was a VERY brief overview, so make sure you check out the
            Bootstrap documentation at
            <a

            Note on branches - if you are working with other developers, you

            >. It is not a best practice to work out of the main branch (which
            is where we're working); however - it's your site, and you can do
            what you want. I work out of the main branch on my own website,
            because I'm the only one here and I am living on the edge.

          <!-- Deploying -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Deploying</h2>
          <p>
            It's time to make our website available to the masses. There are
            lots of ways to deploy a static website, but I'm going to recommend
            one that my friend Matt Rodgers from
            <a href="https://matthewdavidrodgers.com/" target="_blank"
              >matthewdavidrodgers.com</a
            >
            turned me on to: Netlify.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Deploying with Netlify - an anecdote</h5>
          <p>
            Netlify is so easy that when I had a time sensitive emergency to
            deploy a
            <a href="../pickle.html">crude JavaScript pickle mass calculator</a
            >. I turned to Netlify. Even though it was my first time using the
            tool and I had to go through the sign up process, I had a working,
            live pickle mass calculator deployed in under 10 minutes.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Deploying with Netlify</h5>
          <p>Here are your Netlify instructions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">netlify.com</a>
              and sign up using your GitHub account

            Netlify will auto-generate a domain name for you, which you can
            change later. The initial deployment will take a few minutes. In the
            future, every time you make changes to your main branch in GitHub,
            Netlify will automatically deploy in a matter of seconds.
