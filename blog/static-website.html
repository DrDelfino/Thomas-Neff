          <p>
            In this post, I'll show you how to develop and deploy a simple
            website in three steps.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Setting up - Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub</li>
            <li>Developing - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap</li>
            <li>Deploying - Netlify</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We'll use my website,
            <a href="https://thomasneff.com/" target="_blank"
              >thomasneff.com,</a
            >
            as an example along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Please note that these steps are written for Windows users.</i>
          </p>

          <!-- Setting Up -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Setting up</h2>
          <p>
            If you're a seasoned developer, you can probably skip most of this
            section. But if your new to development, let's get you set up.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Download an IDE (Visual Studio Code)</h5>
          <p>
            First, you will want to open (or download) an Integrated Development
            Environment (IDE). This is a fancy name for the software that will
            let you edit your code. Many developers use Visual Studio Code, and
            it's my tool of choice as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://code.visualstudio.com/</a
            >
          </p>

          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a version control tool (Git)</h5>
          <p>
            Next, install Git. Git will help us with version control, making it
            easy to push and pull changes from our command line.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"
              >https://git-scm.com/downloads</a
            >
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a code repository (GitHub)</h5>
          <p>
            Once you have everything installed, it's time to set up a code
            repository. For this example, we'll be using GitHub. Navigate to
            their website and set up an account, if you don't already have one.
            Then, follow the on-screen instructions to create a new repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://github.com/</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You can look at
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository</a
            >
            for this website as an example.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Clone your repository</h5>
          <p>
            We want to make changes to the code in our online repository
            (GitHub) using our local machine's IDE (Visual Studio Code). To do
            that, we need to clone the repository to our local machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navigate to your repository in GitHub. Here is
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository
            </a>
            for this website again as an example. Click on the green button that
            says "Code". It should look similar to the button below.
          </p>
          <button class="btn-github btn-lg mx-auto d-block" href="#">
            <i class="fas fa-download"></i> Code
            <i class="fas fa-sort-down pb-1"></i>
          </button>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Copy the HTTPS link that appears. It should look similar to the
            screenshot below, but with your repository information.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/GitHub-clone.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Open Visual Studio Code. You should be greeted with a welcome screen
            that has a link to clone a repository.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/VSCode-welcome.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Click on <i>clone repository...</i> and paste the link from GitHub.
            You will be prompted to save the repository somewhere on your PC.
          </p>

          <h5 class="pt-3">Summary</h5>
          <p>
            Our development environment is now set up! Here's a quick summary of
            everything we did:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Downloaded Visual Studio Code to edit our code</li>
            <li>Installed Git to help with version control</li>
            <li>Created a code repository in GitHub</li>
            <li>Cloned the code repository to our local machine</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Developing -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Developing</h2>
          <p>
            We made it to the fun part! Time to start developing our website.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a homepage</h5>
          <p>
            Within Visual Studio Code, make sure you are in the folder where you
            cloned your repository. In the file explorer on the left-hand side,
            click on the symbol:
            <img
              class="img"
              style="height: 30px"
              src="../assets/Add-file.png"
            />
            to add a file and name it index.html. This will be the homepage for
            your website. Copy and paste the following code into your index.html
            and hit save.
          </p>
          <p>
            I included some additional comments to help explain the HTML for
            beginners.
          </p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Thomas-Neff/26e2628115f648c1efaf2d634be79819.js"></script>
          <p>
            Note that I included Bootstrap, which is a responsive framework that
            will make our website beautiful on mobile phones as well as desktop
            browsers. I also included popper.js and jQuery JavaScript libraries,
            which are both necessary for Bootstrap to function correctly (though
            Bootstrap 5 has removed jQuery as a requirement).
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Render and view your homepage</h5>
          <p>
            In order to view your code in a browser, we will add an extension
            called Live Server. Click on the symbol:
            <img
              class="img"
              style="height: 30px"
              src="../assets/Extensions.png"
            />
            on the left-hand menu bar in Visual Studio Code to view extensions.
            Search for Live Server, verify the extension is made by "Ritwick
            Dey" (it should be the first result) and click install. After it's
            done installing, you may need to restart Visual Studio Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open index.html within Visual Studio Code, and click on the button:
            <img class="img" style="height: 18px" src="../assets/Go-Live.png" />
            in the bottom right-hand tool bar. Your browser will open and you
            should see a rendering of your local code.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid pb-3"
            src="../assets/first-bootstrap-website.webp"
          />
          <h5 class="pt-3">Understand the Bootstrap grid</h5>
          <p>
            Bootstrap uses a grid system to make your site responsive on any
            screen size. Each row is divided into 12 units.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Below is an example of a row with three <b>equal width</b> columns.
          </p>
          <div class="row text-white text-center pb-3">
            <div class="col-4 bg-primary pt-3">
              <p>
                First of three equal width columns <br />
                [col-4]
              </p>
            </div>

              </p>

            This was a VERY brief overview, so make sure you check out the
            Bootstrap documentation at
            <a
              href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/"
              target="_blank"
              >https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/</a
            >
            for more details on implementation.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Add in styling with CSS</h5>
          <p>
            Using CSS allows you to manage styling across your entire website
            with ease. To start working with CSS, add a new file within your
            Visual Studio Code File Explorer and name it styles.css. Copy and
            paste the following code into your styles.css and hit save.
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Thomas-Neff/83a36b5311360c788449ea663dac8867.js"></script>
          <p>
            In this example, we added a salmon-colored background that we intend
            to use for our headers. Next, we need to link the styles.css sheet
            to our index.html page. To accomplish that, copy and paste the
            following code within the head tag on your index.html page.
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Thomas-Neff/c59c7d9adfa58060c6261482eca8ef99.js"></script>
          <p>
            Also, add your header-background class to your h1 tag, similar to
            the following code snippet.
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Thomas-Neff/6b8e22137e2139b1aecd4e69b779fb76.js"></script>
          <p>
            You should see a salmon-colored background behind your header when
            you render the page.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid pb-3"
            src="../assets/first-bootstrap-website-salmon-background.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Feel free to use styles.css to add in any other custom colors,
            fonts, or additional styling that you want, or take advantage of the
            <a
              href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_all_classes.asp"
              target="_blank"
              >built in classes that bootstrap provides</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Add dynamic features with JavaScript</h5>
          <p>
            Note - we are not creating a "dynamic website" here. That would
            require a backend activity (server side). We are adding in dynamic
            features, in the sense that our static web page's content and user
            experience can change as users interact with it.
          </p>
          <p>TBD</p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Push your code to GitHub</h5>
          <p>TBD</p>
          <p>
            Note - if you are working with other developers, you should
            <a
              href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell"
              target="_blank"
              >learn about branches</a
            >. It is not a best practice to work out of the main branch (which
            is where we're working); however - if it's only you working on the
            site, you may find it easier.

            TBD - custom resume content, adding in the blog for thomasneff.com,

          <h5 class="pt-3">Summary</h5>
          <p>
            We now have the beginnings of a beautiful website. Here is a summary
            of everything we did:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>TBD</li>
            <li>Added the BootstrapCDN to make our site responsive</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Deploying -->
          <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3">Deploying</h2>
          <p>
            It's time to make our website available to the masses. There are
            lots of ways to deploy a static website, but I'm going to recommend
            one that my friend Matt Rodgers from
            <a href="https://matthewdavidrodgers.com/" target="_blank"
              >matthewdavidrodgers.com</a
            >
            turned me on to: Netlify.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Deploying with Netlify - an anecdote</h5>
          <p>
            Netlify is so easy that when I had a time sensitive emergency to
            deploy a
            <a href="../pickle.html">crude JavaScript pickle mass calculator</a
            >. I turned to Netlify. Even though it was my first time using the
            tool and I had to go through the sign up process, I had a working,
            live pickle mass calculator deployed in under 10 minutes.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Deploying with Netlify</h5>
          <p>Here are your Netlify instructions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Go to
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">netlify.com</a>
              and sign up using your GitHub account
            </li>
            <li>
              Click on the <i>New site from Git</i> button and select GitHub
            </li>
            <li>Select your repository</li>
            <li>Click deploy site</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Netlify will auto-generate a domain name for you, which you can
            change later. The initial deployment will take a few minutes. In the
            future, every time you make changes to your main branch in GitHub,
            Netlify will automatically deploy in a matter of seconds.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Congratulations!</h5>
          <p>
            If you followed along, you now have a live, functioning website for
            the world to enjoy. If you are just a reader, hopefully you have a
            better understanding of how I developed and deployed
            <a href="../index.html">thomasneff.com</a>.

          <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
