          </h5>

          <p>
            In this post, I'll show you how I developed and deployed this
            website in three steps.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Setting up - Visual Studio Code, GitHub, npm, Git, Bootstrap
            </li>
            <li>Developing - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li>Deploying - Netlify</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Feel free to follow along and create your own website. It's fast,
            easy, and free!
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Please note that these steps are written for Windows users.</i>
          </p>

          <!-- Setting Up -->
          <h3 class="pt-5 pb-3">Setting up</h3>
          <p>
            If you're a seasoned developer, you can probably skip most of this
            section. But if your new to development, let's get you set up.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Download an IDE (Visual Studio Code)</h5>
          <p>
            First, you will want to open (or download) an Integrated Development
            Environment (IDE). This is a fancy name for the software that will
            let you edit your code. Many developers use Visual Studio Code, and
            it's my tool of choice as well.
          </p>

              >https://code.visualstudio.com/</a
            >
          </p>

          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a package manager (npm)</h5>
          <p>
            Now it's time to install npm (originally Node Package Manager). In
            an effort to keep things simple, let's just say we'll use npm to
            download and install stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank"
              >https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>

              >stack overflow post</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a version control tool (Git)</h5>
          <p>
            Next, install Git. Git will help us with version control, making it
            easy to push and pull changes from our command line.
          </p>

            >
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create a code repository (GitHub)</h5>
          <p>
            Once you have everything installed, it's time to set up a code
            repository. For this example, we'll be using GitHub. Navigate to
            their website and set up an account, if you don't already have one.
            Then, follow the on-screen instructions to create a new repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"
              >https://github.com/</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You can look at
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository</a
            >
            for this website as an example.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Clone your repository</h5>
          <p>
            We want to make changes to the code in our online code repository
            (GitHub) using our local machine's IDE (Visual Studio Code). To do
            that, we need to clone the repository to our local machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navigate to your repository in GitHub. Here is
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Thomas-Neff/Thomas-Neff-Personal-Website"
              target="_blank"
              >my repository
            </a>
            for this website again as an example. Click on the green button that
            says "Code". It should look similar to the button below.
          </p>
          <button class="btn-github btn-lg mx-auto d-block" href="#">
            <i class="fas fa-download"></i> Code
            <i class="fas fa-sort-down pb-1"></i>
          </button>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Copy the HTTPS link that appears. It should look similar to the
            screenshot below, but with your repository information.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/GitHub-clone.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Open Visual Studio Code. You should be greeted with a welcome screen
            that has a link to clone a repository.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-fluid w-50 pb-3 mx-auto d-block"
            src="../assets/VSCode-welcome.webp"
          />
          <p>
            Click on <i>clone repository...</i> and paste the link from GitHub.
            You will be prompted to save the repository somewhere on your PC.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Install a responsive framework (Bootstrap)</h5>
          <p>
            Bootstrap is a front-end framework that helps to make your website
            responsive, ensuring your site will look great on various screen
            sizes. There are lots of ways to install Bootstrap, but let's take
            advantage of our shiny new package manager, npm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within Visual Studio Code, make sure you are in the folder where you
            cloned your repository. Open the terminal using
            <code> Ctrl+Shift+`</code>
            or by clicking terminal > New Terminal in the top menu bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the terminal, verify npm installed correctly by writing the
            command <code>npm -v</code>. You should get back a version number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now install Bootstrap using the command
            <code>npm install bootstrap --save</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Bootstrap to work correctly, you will also need the JavaScript
            library, jQuery. Install jQuery using the command
            <code>npm install jquery --save</code>.
          </p>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Summary</h5>
          <p>
            Our development environment is now set up! Here's a quick summary of
            everything we did:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Downloaded Visual Studio Code to edit our code</li>
            <li>Installed npm to manage packages</li>
            <li>Installed Git to help with version control</li>
            <li>Created a code repository in GitHub</li>
            <li>Cloned the code repository to our local machine</li>
            <li>Installed Bootstrap to make our site responsive</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now let's move on to the fun part: developing.</p>

          <!-- Developing -->
          <h3 class="pt-5 pb-3">Developing</h3>
          <h5 class="pt-3">Create index.html</h5>
          <p>
            Within Visual Studio Code, make sure you are in the folder where you
            cloned your repository. In the file explorer on the left-hand side,
            click on the symbol:
            <img
              class="img"
              style="height: 30px"
              src="../assets/Add-file.png"
            />
            to add a file and name it <i>index.html</i>. This will be the
            homepage for your website. Next, copy and paste the following code
            into your index.html.
          </p>
          <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
            Author's note - need to fix css and js references to hit the correct
            files in the node_modules folder, as well as to not show entire
            filepath.
